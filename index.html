            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Developer at Cake SMP (January 2024 - February 2024)</strong>
                    <p>I used to develop for a Minecraft content creator SMP called Cake SMP owned by Cakcee. My work consisted of fixing bugs that may be found by players to helping code the core functions in Skript, such as giving different abilities to cakes (hence the name).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>System Admin/Developer at Pyla (May 2023 - July 2023)</strong>
                    <p>Pyla is a Minecraft 'Elytra Box' server and my time there consisted of various things, such as helping out the staff with optimising their server, making sure there wasn't any bugs, avoiding crashes or I would help them with developing core Skripts for the server. I resigned as I felt like I wasn't doing enough work however I am still on good terms with the staff team over at Pyla!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Marketing Lead at CreateNow Solutions (March 2023 - August 2023)</strong>
                    <p>CreateNow is a hosting service that provides servers for different games, such as Minecraft and Terraria and even have the ability to host Discord bots. When I was working at CreateNow, I was in charge of the marketing, so the posts which were going out on social media, attracting more people onto the service, etc. When I was there, I had the opportunity to work close with the owner, "Simply" and we were able to create different sub brands that were not limited to just Minecraft Hosting. I resigned as of the 4th of August 2023, as I felt my position wasn't right on the team. I did not feel like a "Marketing Lead" was something I wanted to do and I had other projects which I wanted to pursue.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Marketing Lead at Xenon Platforms (rebranded to MineKeep) (February 2023 - August 2023)</strong>
                    <p>Xenon is a free Minecraft server hosting service that I worked for quite a while on. A lot of things that I did for CreateNow, I also did for Xenon as CreateNow was the aftermath of Xenon's shutdown (it's back up now) but I made videos promoting their service and did frequent streams interacting with the community. I was brought over to CreateNow after Xenon's shutdown which is my role there ended briefly, until it opened back up again and I personally resigned for the reason mention in the 'CreateNow Solutions' section.</p>

                    <strong>Founder of MCIdle (Present)</strong>
                    <p>MCIdle is an upcoming project I am working on which is one of the easiest way to idle your accounts on your favourite Minecraft servers for rewards, more information coming soon...</p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Founder of Auitenti Community (2024)</strong>
                    <p>Auitenti Community, alternatively referred to as "Auitenti" or "Auitenti Studios" operated as a game studio which created experiences on gaming platforms such as Fortnite: Creative, Roblox, and Minecraft. We originally assembled in August 2023 as a small project, creating Minecraft servers for fun, however, overtime we gradually grew into a group full of many talented people all united to create Auitenti.</p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Owner of Badge Online (2023)</strong>
                    <p>Badge was a Minecraft Network, first launched in March 2022, with game modes such as "Lifesteal" and later on "BoxPvP". It was my take on what a good Minehut server network should be like and I'm proud of what I accomplished. I learnt a lot from the people that worked with me, ranging from Mods & Admins to Developers who helped me work on my coding. It was reopened again, alongside the launch of Xenon 2.0, a project I was volunteering for, but sadly closed due to my inability to keep working on it.</p>
